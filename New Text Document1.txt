	It behaves as a safeguard against breaking changes. One of the best ways to keep your project bug free is through a test suite.
	Provides Documentation
	Debugging Process
	Finds Software Bugs Early
	Quality of Code.
	Reduce Costs.

3) Angular 7 application configuration for unit testing, debug and code coverage.

The Angular CLI downloads and install everything you need to test an Angular application with the Jasmine test framework.

code coverage:-
angular.json
"test":{ 
  "options":{   
  "codeCoverage": true 
  }
}
